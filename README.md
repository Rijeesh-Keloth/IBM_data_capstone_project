####IBM Data Science Professional Certificate - Applied Data Science Capstone
Welcome to the final course, the 10th Capstone, of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate specialization. This capstone serves as a comprehensive project, consolidating all the knowledge acquired throughout the entire specialization.

### Project Background
In the era of commercial space travel, SpaceX stands out as the most successful company, revolutionizing affordability in space exploration. The company features Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, boasting a cost of 62 million dollars, significantly less than other providers whose costs soar upwards of 165 million dollars. A key factor contributing to this cost efficiency is SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage. This project aims to predict the likelihood of the first stage being reused, thereby determining the overall launch cost.

###Questions to be Answered
How do variables such as payload mass, launch site, number of flights, and orbits influence the success of the first stage landing?
Does the rate of successful landings show an upward trend over the years?
What is the most effective algorithm for binary classification in this scenario?
##Methodology
1. Data Collection Methodology
